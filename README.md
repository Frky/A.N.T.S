#### Ants Natural Task Simulator ####

This project's main goal is to simulate a development and working routine of an ants colony, implementing :

- Basic natural cycles : birth, feeding, death.
- Usual ants behaviours like colony building, scouting, etc.
- Different classes : worker, soldier, queen,...
- Inter-individuals interaction : food sharing, "handshaking" (species recognition), ...
- Pheromonal communication and trails marking.

#### Compile with :

	javac Simulation.java

### Run with :

	java Simulation (int)nbAnts (int)duration

	(duration is in turns, one turn lasts aproximately 0,05s)
